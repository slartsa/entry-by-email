# entry-by-email
Entry-by-email is a simple solution for providing access controlled websites for users.

## How does it work?
1. You offer a login-input for the user to provide their email-address.
2. Once they give their email-address, a custom link to your preferred hidden page is provided.
3. A special script in the beginning of your hidden page verifies the custom link.
4. Done!

## What do I have to do as a website owner?
1. We provide you with the script that verifies the link and you can put it anywhere you want.
2. We provide you with the input field that sends the request for a custom link to user email.
3. Done!
